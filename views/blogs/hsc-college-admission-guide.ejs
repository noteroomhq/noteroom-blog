        <p class="article-para-text">Let’s be real. HSC admission season in Bangladesh feels like a mix of panic, pressure, and your aunt asking “Which college e porbi?” for the tenth time. It’s confusing, weirdly intense, and unless you’ve got a cousin who just went through it, no one seems to explain it properly.</p>
        <p class="article-para-text">So here’s a clear, honest, and straight-to-the-point guide that helps. Whether you’re aiming for Rajuk, Viqarunnisa, or Dhaka College, or just want to get into a solid college and start fresh, this is for you.</p>
  
        <h2 id="step1">Step 1: Know What You’re Applying For</h2>
        <p class="article-para-text">Before anything else, figure out what you need to get in. Most colleges (especially top ones) want:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>GPA 5.00 if you’re applying to science</li>
          <li>A decent GPA (4.5+ usually safe) for commerce or humanities</li>
          <li>Some ask for subject-specific grades especially in math or science</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="article-para-text">You’ll need:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>SSC transcript and certificate</li>
          <li>Birth certificate</li>
          <li>Recent passport-sized photos</li>
          <li>Mobile number used during SSC registration</li>
          <li>Guardian’s NID (sometimes asked during verification)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="article-para-text"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Scan everything. Keep it in your phone and Google Drive. Losing the original the night before the deadline = pain.</p>
  
        <h2 id="step2">Step 2: Decide Which Colleges to Aim For</h2>
        <p class="article-para-text">There are two types of colleges when it comes to admission:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Merit-based colleges via the government portal — like Rajuk, Viqarunnisa, Dhaka College, Holy Cross, Ideal, etc.</li>
          <li>Institutions like Notre Dame & Holy Cross — they run separate admission processes with their own forms & tests.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="article-para-text">So don’t put Notre Dame in your government preference list — it won’t work. If you’re applying to these colleges, check their websites or Facebook pages directly.</p>
        <p class="article-para-text">For the government portal, you’ll list up to 10 choices — rank them smartly:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>2–3 dream colleges</li>
          <li>4–5 mid-tier options</li>
          <li>2–3 backups (realistic safety net)</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h2 id="step3">Step 3: Make a Study Plan</h2>
        <p class="article-para-text">Look, you don’t need a bullet journal or 4-color highlighters. Just write down:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What subjects you're struggling with</li>
          <li>Topics you want to revise before college starts</li>
          <li>Entrance prep (if you're applying to Notre Dame, Holy Cross, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="article-para-text">If you’re still in “post-SSC chill mode,” that’s fine. But HSC isn’t slow-paced. Having a headstart makes life easier later.</p>
  
        <h2 id="step4">Step 4: Online Form? Here’s What Actually Matters</h2>
        <p class="article-para-text">If you’re going through <code>xiclassadmission.gov.bd</code>, here’s how it works:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Choose up to 10 colleges</li>
          <li>Rank them carefully</li>
          <li>Submit with a small fee via bKash/Nagad</li>
          <li>Wait for your result (they’ll notify you via SMS)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="article-para-text">Things to keep in mind:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Choose shift wisely (morning/evening) — some colleges have separate merit lists</li>
          <li>Save your transaction ID</li>
          <li>Don’t panic if you don’t get your top choice — there are multiple phases for migration and re-application</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="article-para-text">🎯 <strong>Again:</strong> Notre Dame, Holy Cross, etc. do not use this process. You need to collect and submit their form separately.</p>
  
        <h2 id="step5">Step 5: Prep for Mini Admission Tests (If Needed)</h2>
        <p class="article-para-text">Colleges like Notre Dame, Holy Cross, and a few others might ask for small written tests, usually based on SSC-level English and general knowledge.</p>
        <p class="article-para-text">So brush up on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Basic English grammar and comprehension</li>
          <li>Current events and GK</li>
          <li>Short essay or paragraph writing</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="article-para-text">If you’ve taken board exams, you’re more than ready. You just need to dust off the brain cells and review a little.</p>
  
        <h2 id="step6">Step 6: Plan for Fees (Yeah, It Adds Up Fast)</h2>
        <p class="article-para-text">HSC admission isn’t super expensive, but the little things add up:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Online form fee (around ৳150–200)</li>
          <li>College admission fees (can be ৳2,000–৳12,000 depending on institution)</li>
          <li>Uniforms, books, ID photos, coaching fees if you plan to join any</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="article-para-text">Start tracking early so nothing catches you off guard.</p>
  
        <h2 id="step7">Step 7: Ask for Help</h2>
        <p class="article-para-text">If this whole process is making you overthink everything, talk to someone. Ask a friend, older cousin, or a teacher. Even the local photocopy guy near the college usually knows what’s up.</p>
        <p class="article-para-text">This isn’t about being the smartest in the room — it’s about getting through the process without messing up something small.</p>
  
        <h2 id="bonus">Bonus: This Is Your Fresh Start (Rebrand Time)</h2>
        <p class="article-para-text">HSC life gives you a rare chance to change how you show up. If you want to switch from the “I barely passed SSC” kid to the “I’m actually trying now” version of yourself — this is it.</p>
        <p class="article-para-text">New college, new habits, maybe even a new group of friends.</p>
        <p class="article-para-text">So start fresh. Get organized. Write that first list. You don’t need to have everything figured out, but knowing where you’re headed makes a big difference.</p>
        <p class="article-para-text">If this helped, keep an eye out as we’ll be dropping more guides to help with HSC life, university prep, and figuring out what comes next.</p>
        <p class="article-para-text">And yeah, if your relatives ask again “kothay apply korcho?” — now you’ve got answers.</p>
